# Database(s)

## Development

The DB component is an instance of [BCDevOps/docker-weasyprint](https://github.com/BCDevOps/docker-weasyprint), and the image being used is pulled from https://hub.docker.com/r/bcgovimages/weasyprint. As such, there is no build associated with this service - just the Deployment.

## Deployment

To deploy the DCBR weasyprint on an instance of OpenShift, use the [OpenShift Developer Tools](https://github.com/BCDevOps/openshift-developer-tools).
